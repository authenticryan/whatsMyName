# whatsMyName

**Inputs given** - Name, Gender, Year of Birth.

**Data Set** - US baby names dataset given by Social Security, CSV Format. 

**Business Logic** - Takes your name and looks up the popularity index of your name in your birth year. That popularity index helps understand your new name, if you were born in any other year, up to 2018. 

**Example** - My name is Ryan and born in 1997. If Ryan is the 53rd most popular name in 1997, the code logic indicates to me that if I were born in 2011, I would be Mathew, as Mathew was the 53rd most popular name in 2011.
